# Bad Chess

This will (soon) be a simple site where you can play chess against a selection of weak engines.

# Planned Opponents

## Arbitrary Random Move (ARM)

The digital equivalent of a child closing their eyes and (legally) randomly moving a piece

## Bongcloud Kingmarch

Starts with the bongcloud, the quintessential bad chess opening, then the king leads from where all good leaders should: the front.

## Hyper Agressive

ARM's angry older brother. Plays random moves until it can take something, then does that at every available opportunity.

## Pawnstorm

Pawns only, baby!

## Terrible CNN

A Convolutional Neural Network that has neither enough parameters or training time to have a hope of playing well.

## Sandbag

A much stronger neural network that has been trained extensively...to mimic the moves of weak players using Lichess' game database.
